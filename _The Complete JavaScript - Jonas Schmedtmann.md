# The Complete JavaScript  Course
by Jonas Schmedtmann

> ## Excerpt
> The modern JavaScript course for everyone! Master JavaScript with projects, challenges and theory. Many courses in one!

**Course Outcome**

_By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer._

**So what exactly is covered in the course?**
-   Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns
-   Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more
-   Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more
-   How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.
-   Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
-   Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. \[This is like a small standalone course\]
-   Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. \[This is like a small standalone course\]
-   Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules
